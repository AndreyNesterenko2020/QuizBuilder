# Description
A quiz building app where you can make quizzes.
# QuizBuilder documentation
You will notice a button that says 'add question'.
When clicked, this button will add a question to
the list of questions right below it. If you want
to edit the contents of a question, just click on
it. Once you clicked on a question, you will see
a dialog box pop up. In the dialog box there are
a lot of text fields. Once you have filled them
all in, just press 'save'. If you want to save your
quiz and you clicked the 'save quiz' button, copy
the quiz code. If you want to play your quiz, you
will need a copy of QuizEngine v1.1.1 in the root directory.
You can get Quiz Engine here:
https://github.com/AndreyNesterenko2020/QuizEngine.
This is just a user interactable app, so saying
'documentation' about this user manual would just
be kinda weird, but whatever.
Also - the times on Github releases are not exact.
If you want to see the time of release, check when
the file quizBuilder_v1.x.html was last modified.
